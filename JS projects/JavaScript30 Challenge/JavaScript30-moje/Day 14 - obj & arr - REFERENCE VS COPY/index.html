    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2); //100, 100
      age = 200; //this will only change the variable 'age'
      console.log(age, age2); //200, 100

      let name = 'Juli';
      let name2 = name;
      console.log(name, name2); //Juli, Juli
      name = 'Julian'; //this will only change the variable 'age'
      console.log(name, name2); //Julian, Juli

    // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players; //doesnt actually work like that
      console.log(players, team) // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'],
                                 // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      //team[3] = 'Lux';
      console.log(team);    // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'],
      console.log(players); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']  => NOT A COPY! => With Arrays it doesnt work like with Strings, Numbers and Booleans => It changes the origial Array!

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a COPY instead! (WE HAVE MANY POSSIBILITIES)
      // one way
        const team2 = players.slice(); //usually with splice() you select certain elements and save it as a copy (2, 4 = from the 2nd to the 3rd index => second parameter is always not inclucded) => if you dont pass anything it will jsut create a copy of that original Array!
        team2[3] = 'Lux';
        console.log(team2);   //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
        console.log(players); //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'] => dont forget to delete the team[3] = 'Lux'; so that it works!

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [];
        team3.push(...players);

      // or we use Array.from() method
        const team5 = Array.from(players)

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects => same as Arrays
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

      // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person;
        captain.number = 99; //will also add this property to the original 'person' Array

      // how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99}); //{} most often start with a blank object => then pass in the wanted object (person) => and then
        console.log(cap2);   //name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80, number: 99
        console.log(person); //name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80 => remember to delete the const captain = person; + captain.number = 99;

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread  => in react its possible

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

        const wes = {
          name: 'Wes',
          age: 100,
          social: {
            twitter: '@wesbos',
            facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
          }
        };

        const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

        dev.name = 'Dick';

        console.log(wes); //same
        console.log(dev); //name: Dick

        dev.social.twitter = 'hey';

        console.log(wes); //social: 'Dick' =>you can edit only one level deep
        console.log(dev); //social: 'Dick'


        //find a clone deep function or use this to edit deeper levels in the object:
        //JSON.stringify = makes the object a string => JSON.parse = immidietaly turns the String back to a Object => makes a copy out of it
        const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

        const items =  [
          {name: 'Bike', price: 100},
          {name: 'TV', price: 200},

        ]
